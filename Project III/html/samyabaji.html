        <h2>Samay Baji (Newari food platter)</h2>
        <p>
          Samay Baji is the most popular Newari food of Newari people in Nepal.
          It consists of many dishes served with beaten rice on a single
          platter. It is served with local Aila (spirit) or Chyaang (Sakki like
          white wine). It is traditionally prepared during the festivals and
          other occasions as a symbol of love and happiness. Hence 'Samay Baji'
          symbolises a food in a happy time where Samay is time and baji is
          beaten rice.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the special traditional occasion of the Newari feast (known as
          lapate bhwoye), a unique sitting arrangement, placing narrow straw
          mats for the guests to sit face to face. Then, the lapate (leaf plate)
          is placed in front of each guest with a paala (small clay bowl)
          alongside. The serving starts from the elder members, and slowly
          everyone is served. Starting with two hand-full of the beaten rice
          (the baji), turn-wise, all the delicacies are served on the plate,
          surrounding the place with a festive vibe. The aroma of the dishes
          enhances the feast. The paala on the side is filled with aila
          (homemade liquor), which completes the serving of the extravagant
          Newari cultural Samaya Baji.

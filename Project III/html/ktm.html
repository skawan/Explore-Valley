          <h3>Boudhanath Stupa</h3>

          <p>
            Situated at a distance of about 11 kilometres from the city centre
            of Kathmandu, Boudhanath Stupa dominates the Kathmandu skyline with
            its gargantuan spherical shape. Thousands of pilgrims from different
            religions gather here daily. They perform a ritualistic
            circumnavigation, known as the 'kora', of the colossal dome. It is
            believed that anyone who circumambulates the stupa with no ill
            thoughts in their hearts receives good karma. Moreover, the gates of
            hell are permanently closed for them! The massive mandala of this
            magisterial stupa makes it the largest in Nepal and the continent.
            In1979, Boudhanath Stupa was honoured as a UNESCO World Heritage
            Site. The Boudhanath Stupa has acquired several names throughout the
            years, including the Buddha Stupa, Chorten Chempo, Chaitya, Jarung
            Khashor, and the Khasti. The entire complex of the stupa houses 50
            Tibetan convents, known as gompas, which have been acting as
            shelters for the Tibetan refugees since 1959. This stupa is said to
            be the spot where the remains of Kassapa Buddha lay in rest.

          <h3>Garden of Dreams</h3>

          <p>
            Garden of Dreams in Kathmandu, also referred to as the 'Swapna
            Bageecha' and 'garden of six seasons is a neo-classical garden in
            Kathmandu built by Kishore Narshingh in1920. The garden has a
            magnificent amphitheatre, urns, gorgeous pavilions, paved perimeter
            paths, pergolas, and ponds that draw in locals and tourists alike.
            After the patron of this garden, Kaiser Sumsher Rana, passed away in
            the 1960s, the site lay in neglect until recent years, when it was
            beautifully restored by the Austrian government and reopened for
            visitors.

          <h3>Pashupatinath Temple</h3>

          <p>
            One of the holiest Hindu shrines in Nepal, the Pashupatinath Temple
            is stretched across both the banks of the beautiful and sacred
            Bagmati River on the eastern fringes of the capital city of
            Kathmandu. The magnificent sanctum devoted to Lord Shiva draws in
            thousands of devotees who come to offer their prayers and seek
            blessings from him. Sprawled over a large area with temples and
            ashrams, it is believed that the Jyotirlinga housed in the
            Pashupatinath temple is the head of the body which is made up of the
            twelve Jyotirlinga in India. In 1979, the magnificent temple was
            declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

          <h3>Langtang National Park</h3>

          <p>
            With trekking trails, lush greenery, and a variety of species of
            flora and fauna, the Langtang National Park is the fourth national
            park that was established in Nepal in 1976. The Langtang National
            Park is situated at an approximate distance of 32 kilometres to the
            north of the capital city of Kathmandu and is connected to the
            Qomolangma National Nature Preserve in Tibet. The picturesque park
            is also home to the serene, high altitude Gosaikunda Lake, which is
            believed to be sacred. From the dense forests which comprise the
            hilly areas, the area of the park spreads across the Nepalese larch
            in the middle before cascading down to the vast meadows of green
            grasslands. With more than 250 species of birds, around 46 species
            of mammals, and a whopping 1000 species of plants, this place is
            ideal for nature enthusiasts. Sprawled across an area of 1710 square
            kilometres in the Rasuwa, Nuwakot, and the Sindhupalchok districts,
            the park encompasses 26 Village Executives and is perched at an
            altitudinal range of 6450 metres above sea level. The peak of the
            gigantic Langtang Lirung, at an altitude of 7245 metres, is the
            zenith of the park. The numerous trekking tracks, each differing in
            its level of difficulty from the other cater to those who come here
            seeking adventure. While the international boundary of Tibet
            coincides with the borders of the park in the north and east, the
            western border follows the gushing rivers Trisuli and Bhote Kosi.
            The protected area within the park is representative of both the
            Palearctic and Indo-Malayan ecozones, which houses a rich and vast
            biodiversity.

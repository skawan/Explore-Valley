          <h3>55 Windows Palace, Bhaktapur Overview</h3>

          <p>
            The Palace of Fifty-five Windows was built by King Jitamitra Malla
            for his 55 wives, with one window for each of them. The palace of 55
            Windows dates back to the 18th Century. Apart from this iconic
            monument of love, the said king also laid down the foundation stone
            for another iconic structure in the vicinity - the Nyatapola Temple.
            The inside of the palace has been closed for visitors for many years
            now. The Golden Gate also called as Sun Dhoka, is the entrance to
            several inner courtyards around the palace. The Golden Gate one of
            the most lavish and important artefacts in Nepal. There is also a
            holy pool near the palace called Naga Pokari which is believed to be
            used by goddess Taleju for daily ritual baths. It was built like a
            water tank and it is encircled by a cobra.

          <h3>Bhaktapur Durbar Square</h3>

          <p>
            The Bhaktapur Durbar Square is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was
            once home to the royal family of Bhaktapur. Locally known as Khwopa
            or the ancient Newa City, visitors can explore the entire complex
            that consists of four different squares – Taumadhi Square, Durbar
            Square, Pottery Square and Dattatreya Square. Typical findings here
            are the Bhaktapur royal palaces along with several temples and other
            ancient structures dating back to the 17th and the 18th century.
            Bhaktapur Durbar Square is located about 13 kilometres to the east
            of the Kathmandu Valley. The entire square is a massive display of
            traditional Newari architecture. Every building is a work of art in
            itself and visitors are sure to enjoy exploring. The square was
            severely damaged in the 1934 and 2015 earthquakes that hit Nepal.
            Most of the ancient architecture suffered, and several buildings,
            statues and structures were destroyed. Other buildings underwent
            some restoration, but visitors can still see the signs of the
            damage.

          <h3>Taumadhi Square</h3>

          <p>
            Located right next to the famous Durbar Square, Taumadhi square is
            often left unnoticed while travelling to Bhaktapur but one has to
            explore it in order to know about ancient legends and adore ancient
            architecture. The square is very popular among tourists because of
            the beautifully structured stones and carvings on the wood. The
            stone sculptures are a major attraction in this square. It
            represents the ancient life in Bhaktapur. Also known as Taumadi
            Tole, it owes much of its reputation to be the site for Nyatapola
            Temple, the tallest temple in Nepal towering to a height of 30
            metres.

          <h3>Nyatapola Temple</h3>

          <p>
            Nyatapola Temple is an 18th-century temple located in Bhaktapur,
            Nepal. It is the tallest building in the valley and the tallest
            temple in the country. The temple was built in 1702 and is dedicated
            to Goddess Siddhi Lakshmi, an incarnation of Goddess Parvati. The
            idol of the Goddess, which is installed in the sanctum sanctorum, is
            believed to be extremely fearsome. Although only the temple priests
            enter the sanctum sanctorum, visitors can explore the rest of the
            temple. The monument has survived two major earthquakes in the
            region and has suffered minor damages. It is also, therefore, known
            for its structural strength. Nyatapola Temple was built during the
            reign of King Bhupatindra Malla. He belonged to the Malla Dynasty
            and ruled Bhaktapur between 1692 and 1722. The temple has
            traditional pagoda-style architecture with a five-storey roof that
            makes it a strikingly tall building in the region. It took about
            seventeen months to build the temple during the time. The Goddess it
            is dedicated to is believed to be Tantric and hence, is also called
            Tantric Lakshmi.

          <h3>Changu Narayan</h3>

          <p>
            Changu Narayan is a synonymous word with both the old Nepalese
            temple and the village that surrounds it. Located in the Bhaktapur
            district some 12 km east of Kathmandu, Changu Narayan is the oldest
            temple in Nepal and has an authentic Newari style architecture very
            true to its roots. With its two-storey brick-red edifice, the
            beautiful temple perches atop a hill which is also called Changu or
            sometimes Dolagiri. The Changu Narayan temple is devoted to Lord
            Vishnu and houses several of his avatars and some other deities as
            well. And like every other Hindu temple in the subcontinent, this
            temple too has two separate faiths regarding its past – one
            corresponds with the recorded history as we know it and another one
            is a legend as told by the local folklore. Surrounding Changu
            Narayan are dense woods of Champak tree, and this forest plays an
            important role in the legends associated with the temple.

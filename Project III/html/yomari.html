        <h2>Yomari (Rice flour dumpling)</h2>
        <p>
          Yomari is a Newari food eaten during the festival of Yomari Punhi in
          Nepal. It signifies the month of Poush in the Nepal Era Calendar which
          falls in Purnima (a full moon day). It is also known by a name
          Ya-Mari. 'Ya' means like and 'Mari' means delicacy. It is also
          prepared during special occasions like birthdays and baby showers. It
          is also a very popular Nepalese food. Yomari is a steamed dumpling
          with a filling of sweet ingredient 'Chhaku' (made from jaggery or
          molasses or palm sugar). Leftover Yomari can also be a great
          alternative for the breakfast.

          Locals have different versions regarding the origin of the yomari. One
          legend has it that a couple in Panchal (today’s Panauti) prepared this
          form of confection and distributed it to their neighbours. The
          neighbours loved the confection and hence named it yomari—the Newa
          word ‘ya’ translates ‘to like’ and ‘mari’ to ‘roti or flatbread’. The
          legend goes that Kubera, the god of wealth, who had come to the
          village disguised as a beggar was also given yomari. He was very happy
          with the couple’s generosity and blessed them with wealth and
          prosperity. He told the couple that anyone who prepares yomari with
          the shapes of gods and goddesses on the full moon day will be blessed
          with wealth and prosperity. Since then, it is believed that the Newa
          community started celebrating the festival.
